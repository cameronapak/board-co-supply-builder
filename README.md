## Data Models

### Order System Types

The application includes comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation schemas for type-safe order processing:

#### Core Interfaces

- **`SkateboardOrder`**: Main order entity with design configuration, customer info, pricing, and status tracking
- **`CustomerInfo`**: Customer contact information with billing and shipping addresses
- **`Address`**: Standardized address format for billing and shipping
- **`OrderPricing`**: Detailed pricing breakdown including base price, artwork fees, shipping, taxes, and totals

#### Squarespace API Integration Types

- **`SquarespaceOrderRequest`**: Request format for creating orders via Squarespace Commerce API
- **`SquarespaceOrderResponse`**: Response format from Squarespace order creation
- **`SquarespaceLineItem`**: Product line items with customization support
- **`SquarespaceAddress`**: Squarespace-specific address format

#### Validation Schemas

All interfaces include corresponding Zod schemas for runtime validation:

- Form validation for client-side input
- API request/response validation
- Data transformation between internal and Squarespace formats

#### Database Schema

Orders are stored in the `orders` table with the following structure:

- `id`: Auto-generated primary key
- `userId`: Foreign key to authenticated user
- `squarespaceOrderId`: Reference to Squarespace order
- `orderReference`: Unique order reference number
- `designConfig`: JSON string containing design parameters (zoom, pan, rotation, artwork URL)
- `artworkFileId`: Reference to uploaded artwork file in S3 storage
- `customerInfo`: JSON string with billing and shipping information
- `pricing`: JSON string with detailed pricing breakdown
- `status`: Order status (`pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`)
- `createdAt`/`updatedAt`: Timestamp tracking

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (see `.nvmrc` for version)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd skateboard-designer
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:

```bash
# Database (for production)
LIBSQL_DATABASE_URL="your-turso-database-url"
LIBSQL_DATABASE_TOKEN="your-turso-auth-token"

# S3-compatible storage for file uploads
S3_API_URL="your-s3-endpoint"
S3_ACCESS_KEY="your-s3-access-key"
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-s3-secret-key"

# Squarespace Commerce API
SQUARESPACE_API_KEY="your-squarespace-api-key"
```

#### Database Setup

For local development, the app uses a file-based SQLite database automatically (`.astro/content.db`). For production, set up a [Turso](https://turso.tech) database.

The database schema is automatically created from the `bknd.config.ts` configuration, including:

- **Users table**: Managed by Bknd authentication system
- **Posts table**: Example content entities
- **Comments table**: Example comment system
- **Orders table**: Custom skateboard orders with full relationship mapping

Create an admin user:

```bash
npx tsx node_modules/.bin/bknd user create
```

The system will automatically seed with default users:

- Admin: `admin@example.com` / `password`
- User: `user@example.com` / `password`

## Development

### Start Development Server

```bash
# Use correct Node version (if using nvm)
nvm use

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:4321`

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with asset copying
npm run build        # Production build with asset optimization
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run db:reset-local  # Reset local SQLite database
```
